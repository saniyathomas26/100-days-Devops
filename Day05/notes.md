
# Day 05 – SELinux Configuration
## Task

Install required SELinux packages and permanently disable SELinux on the application server for testing purposes.

## Server

App Server 3 (Stratos Datacenter)

## Purpose

SELinux is a mandatory access control mechanism that enhances system security by enforcing security policies. Installing the required SELinux packages ensures the system is properly prepared for future security configurations. Temporarily disabling SELinux allows testing and configuration changes to be performed without policy enforcement issues. SELinux will remain disabled after reboot until it is intentionally re-enabled following the completion of required configurations.
