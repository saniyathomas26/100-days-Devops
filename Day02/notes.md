# Day 02 – Termporary User Creation

## Task:- 
Create a temporary user with an expiry date for a limited-duration project assignment.

## User Details:-
Username: james
Account Expiry Date: 2027-01-28
Shell: /bin/bash (default)

## Purpose:-
A temporary user account is created when access is required only for a fixed period of time. Setting an expiry date ensures that the account is automatically disabled after the specified date, improving security and preventing unauthorized long-term access without manual intervention.
