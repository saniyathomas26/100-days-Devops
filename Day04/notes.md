## Task
Grant executable permissions to a backup automation script and ensure it can be executed by all users.

## Server
App Server 3 (Stratos Datacenter)

## Purpose
Granting executable permissions allows the script to be run as a command. Providing execute access to all users ensures that the backup automation can be triggered by any authorized user or system process without permission issues.
